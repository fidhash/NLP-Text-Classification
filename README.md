# NLP-Text-Classification

This project focuses on emotion classification from text samples using machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed by cleaning, tokenizing, and removing stopwords. Features are extracted using TF-IDF, and two models—Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—are trained to classify the emotions. Both models are evaluated using accuracy and F1-score, with Naive Bayes achieving 98% accuracy and SVM slightly outperforming with 99% accuracy.

The project showcases the steps involved in text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation for emotion classification.
